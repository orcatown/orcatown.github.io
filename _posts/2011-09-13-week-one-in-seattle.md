Other than our deep dismay in discovering that we have a fatty with a penchant for pacing on a squeaky floorboard above our bedroom in the middle of the night, Seattle has been a good experience.  The ferries are charming and lovely to ride, and there is something comforting about watching their half-hourly movement across the sound.

We took a ferry out to Bainbridge Island, a 35 minute ride from Seattle.  The Island was surprisingly charming, with a small town like those found commonly in Virginia. We wandered the farmers market and walked to the harbor. I’d like to go back and go kayaking, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed for good weather this Saturday.

I did not puke on the ferry ride, which was excellent.

*Seattle*

The space needle is just awful. And you see it from everywhere. And supposedly it is the only building that is guaranteed to survive the 9.o earthquake that threatens Seattle.

*C.H.I.P.S*

Mom will definitely love Bainbridge Island, so we’ll have to go when she and Dad get out here to visit. I keep planning in my head what I want my family to see out here, and it helps me avoid homesickness.  Well, I don’t really care for DC all that much, so I suppose it is more familysickness.

Leelou and Mali

The cats like the views as well, though they aren’t happy about being in an apartment without furniture.  Lee misses his girlfriend Mali, aka “Cutiepuff”. Henry misses neither Teddy nor Mali.
