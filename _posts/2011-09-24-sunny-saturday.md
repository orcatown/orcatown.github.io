So one thing that people in Seattle love to talk about it the weather. Possibly because they have the country’s worst collection of sports teams, who really knows. But the weather is always a very hot topic of conversation, and a forecast for a sunny days visibly cheers up the populace. Today was one of those forecasted sunny days, so Chris and I decided to join the rest of the city outside. We spent most of the day on Bainbridge Island, which we had gone to a few weeks ago. Originally we planned on going to Olympic National or Rainier National parks, but after a long week of work, neither of really wanted to spend 3 hours in the car.

*Land Ho!*

The walk to the ferry terminal is only about thirty minutes, and on a sunny day, it’s best to take advantage of the free Vitamin D while it lasts.  Apparently, (at least according to Seattleites), the sun is going to go away tomorrow and not appear until next Summer. Honestly, multiple people have told us this.

*So long sun, see you in 7-9 months!*

I inwardly roll my eyes at this. I had enough pessimism after years on the east coast, I don’t need more here. Although in retrospect, people always think that other parts of the country has unlivable weather. This is especially true if these people live in DC; they tend to think that anything north of the Mason-Dixon line will leave a person living like a Jack London character, eventually freezing to death ala To Build a Fire.

*Living in the north also means you probably eat snow weasel*

So anyway, sunshine is appreciated here like I have never seen before, and it is charming.

*Blackberries are everywhere*

We spent a few hours on the Island, just enjoying the walk.

We also enjoyed being out of our apartment because it faces the Southwest, and thus the lack of air conditioning + 70 degree weather + sunshine means the apartment heats up to about 80-85 degrees during the day. The cats are fried.

We stayed in tonight and just hung around; Chris watched the DC United game while I painted. I did finish a drawing for a card I’m making for my brand new coworker/friend’s wedding. She is getting married tomorrow, so I thought I would giver her a congratulatory card. She likes steampunk, so I tried my hand at the style and made a quick heart drawing to turn into the card.

*Eh, not as hard looking as steampunk should be, but there you go.*

Lee and Henry can’t wait to see their Uncle Kai in a week and a half.

I’ve been collecting up those kiosk flyers for sites around town so I can go through them with Kai as soon as he gets here.

*I know someone who will want to go here. Not Kai though.*
