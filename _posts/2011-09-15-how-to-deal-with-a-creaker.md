title: How to Deal With a "Creaker"
published: true
---

So after three noisy nights in our new apartment, Chris finally got the manager and maintenance man to come into our apartment and listen. Consensus was . . . the floor upstairs will have to be fixed.  In fact, the early assessment was that this creak wasn’t just a loose nail or rubbing floorboard, but probably a broken joist. The corporate office will have to come out tomorrow to assess how and when they will fix the floor. For once, an apartment noise issue that can be fixed! Since there is the possibility of fatty upstairs falling through the ceiling, action must be taken. Too bad Hacky from our apartment in Crystal City wasn’t causing structural damage.

So no rain yet, but lots of clouds. The overcast weather does create some nice scenes from our balconies and windows though, and many people have their sailboats out. I’m pretty sure Ken and Dad should move out here just for that reason.

We haven’t finished unpacking completely, but we’re working on it. The more we move, the less anxious we are to have everything unpacked. Plus, all my clothes are a wrinkled mess, and I don’t really want to face them.

Seattle is definitely a world unto itself, my coworkers told me that there are Seattle-crazy people and really-crazy-people who live in Seattle. I’d agree with that so far.

Last night Chris and I went out to dinner with a coworker of mine and her husband. We had a fantastic time, they were really interesting people, and they took us to a french restaurant called 74. The best part of the meal was the old fashioned airplane landing/arrival switchboard showing wine selections, and the bathroom music that sounded like background music to a 1950’s movie. The food was good too; deconstructed northwest meets France.

Work has been good so far – my coworkers are all very kind and they seem sane and normal, with solid lives outside the office. Though I did listen to a 30 minute treatise on why Seattle drivers are worse than DC drivers. Honestly, all the complaints about Seattle drivers (they go at speed limit, they drive with a lot of space between cars, they stop of pedestrians and at yellow lights) sound like my driving. Kai and Dad of course would go insane.

So far we like the neighborhood, it is very walkable. Lots of varied restaurants and store in Queen Anne.

I think we’re finally adjusting from EST to PST. The cats on the other hand, are just all muddled up. All they know is that their stomachs are on both Eastern and Pacific time, so they beg for food round the clock to hedge their bets.
