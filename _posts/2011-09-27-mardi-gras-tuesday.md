Today was a bit of a blue day, I think because it is a few weeks into the move, and the novelty has worn off enough that a little homesickness set in. Chris and I have been having a great time exploring the city, but I was used to a big group of friends from work who we hung out with in the evenings and on the weekends, and I’m feeling a little lonely for them.

Lee and Henry feel absolutely no homesickness. They love the apartment and Lee danced with joy when he saw my Mother’s anniversary gift to Chris and I.

Since today was a little blue, we decided to go out to dinner at the Cajun/Creole style restaurant that is up the street in Queen Anne, Toulouse Petit.

Seattle is a foodie town – most of the restaurants serve food cooked from local items. This is partially a  gimmick, but also makes sense in a region that has long been isolated from the rest of the country. That being said, we ordered fried tomatoes, fried Chicken and Jambalaya, which aren’t particularly Pacific Northwestern. More like salty Oysters, friend Salmon and, I don’t know, bear and cougar pie.

*Jambalaya*

I brought back leftovers, so it will be interesting to see if the cats will try Jambalaya chicken. Although the aftermath would be messy and I don’t know if I would want to clean up after that.

Also helping in the cheering-up process was a trip to the local drug store to get candy corn. Every year for the past nine years Chris has made fun of my “holiday eating habits.”

“You eat the CRAPPIEST holiday foods!” He said to me tonight.

“What are you talking about?” I asked.

“The candy corn, peeps, those Christmas tree cakes. They’re terrible.”

“I resent that. They are cordon bleu approved.”

So off to the drug store to buy some amazing and refined candy corn.  We also saw this amazing example of what Chris says is marketing piggybacking.

*Twilight? No...*

All in all, despite the homesickness, it was a nice evening. Kai comes a week from Thursday, which is good impetus for us to finally put the last bits and pieces away.
