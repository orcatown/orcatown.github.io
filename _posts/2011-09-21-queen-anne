It has been a nice second-week-of-work for both Chris and I; Chris has had to be on the computer by 7,00AM to start work due to the time changes, though he seems to be adjusting to waking up earlier than usual.  The cats like us being up at 6,30 so they get fed breakfast when the sun is up.  I’m technically in the same job as before, but the day-to-day work is completely different and far more interesting.

The cats have had a nice week, Lee enjoys the windows and watching seagulls sore past majestically.

Henry started off hunting season right with a magnificent quarry, a housefly that he promptly tried to eat after a rough and tumble fight to the death.

I realized after work today that if I want to hike without passing out, I need to actually walk up hills more often.  I walked through Queen Anne, our neighborhood, to the park at the top of the hill. It’s the place where most photographs of Seattle are taken, since it places the Space Needle neatly in the front of downtown, with Ranier in the background.

Mount Ranier looked especially large tonight, Mom says it’s because of the atmosphere.

The cascade mountains are west of Seattle.

The Olympics are right to the East.

Seattle itself may not be the most beautiful city architecturally (that would be Chicago), but it rivals Switzerland for outer-city views.

Now if I could only get the cats to stop screaming at me every time I walk through the door (they think my entry means food should appear in their bowls).
