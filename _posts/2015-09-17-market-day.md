We’ve mostly been spending our free time unpacking, but yesterday we made our way to a restaurant above Pikes Place market for dinner.

Originally we went to a French restaurant, but after 15 minute waiting for a waiter (the job title was not a misnomer in this case), we walked out and found a Bolivian place with great views of the main market street and Llamas on the menu.

*No Llama on the menu, false advertising.*

Today we decided to actually finish unpacking, so the apartment looks slightly nicer. The cats are disappointed that all the paper and boxes are slowly leaving.

We had lunch at a chowder restaurants, and Chris decided it was the best clam chowder he had ever had. If Seattle has one thing, it is fish. In fact, on days the wind blows from the west, the city smells like the Sound. Fishy.

The market is famous for two things – fish (there it is again) and flowers, so there is a definite odor of fishy flowers, with a little bit of fruit mixed in.  We got a gigantic bouquet of flowers for only $10.00 – because there are so many flower vendors, the prices are incredibly low.

We did not buy any fish.  I’m determined to learn how to cook fish better, but I figure I’d like to stick to the type that I don’t have to debone.

Here are the fish.

We walked by the cruise terminal. I’ve been asking around about the best cruise from Seattle to Alaska, in case Mom, Dad, Ken or Joan are interested in going with us. Dad mentioned going to Alaska, and apparently the cruises are a really good way to get around. Normally I think of cruises as floating bacteria buildings, but these seem kind of fun.

*Fun!*

Tomorrow we are hiking, hopefully at Little Si. But since you need passes in your car to park at certain parks, we can only go where they take the State Parks Discover pass, the only one we bought so far. Also available? Washington Forest Pass and National Parks pass. Good grief.

*The cats will spend the day sleeping. They say fie on hiking.*
