title: Sunday Also Lived Up to Its Name

So much for the naysayers last week – Sunday was sunnier than Saturday. We are having a beautiful sunset right now, with wind blowing in from the west.

The wind was very strong last night at about 4AM. We were both woken up by the wind racing in through the windows, and one gust even opened one of our balcony doors. Chris found the door open after hearing some noise the living room, and it caused an immediate panic over the whereabouts of Lee.

Henry of course was right with us, because he is the baby. He turns two in a month, and of course since we don’t have human kids yet, he gets to fill in as surrogate.

Speaking of two years, we just had our two year wedding anniversary a week ago. Chris took me out to a seafood restaurant built on the end of a pier. It had fantastic food, and a panoramic view of west Seattle and the sunset behind the mountains. We had such a fantastic time at the wedding two years ago, it was nice to take some time and remember it.  We were also very touched to well-wishes from the Dowlings and the Schetters that day, it made us feel close to the family even though we’re so far away. Seriously, who thought about building a city this far north and west? It feels like we’re in the Aleutians sometimes. Here is a photo of us with our folks and siblings.
