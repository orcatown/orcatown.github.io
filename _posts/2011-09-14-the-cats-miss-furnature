So today is the day we officially move-in to our apartment, in that today is the day we actually get furniture. We’ve spent the past two nights sleeping on the floor in sleeping bags.

*Ugh*

About 1,00AM I considered dragging my sleeping bag to the park across the sleep to hang out with the derelicts. Exhaustion-induced ideas are generally how people end up on TLC specials like “Stabbed by a Hobo”.

We’re slowly adjusting off jet-lag, although the cats still think 3,30AM is the best time to prance around the apartment mewling for breaky-fast.

*Beefy Feast is apparently a good breakfast.*

But staying up till 9,00PM (so late!) means at least seeing the sunsets from our apartment.  The sun goes down behind the Olympic Mountain range, which is on the Olympic Peninsula west of us. It took me four tries to just spell “peninsula”, which doesn’t speak well of my brain function.

We get to see a variety of boats in Puget sound; ferries, sailboats, cruise ships, tug boats, and my favorite, the fire boats.

The nice thing about where we live is that we are only a 20 minute walk from downtown. Last night I was able to walk to Pike Place before the stands closed for some peaches. For someone who hates driving, this is the height of awesome.

Last Sunday we also went to check out Pioneer Square, although it was so early in the morning when we went that the only people out were the street characters. We would have spent more time checking out Occidental Park, but between the men shout-singing in Spanish and the hobo with a tamborine, we decided to wait.

*Pioneer Park Totem*

The Totem in Pioneer Park comes with a good story. The original was stolen from an Indian tribe north of Seattle. When it burned in a fire, the city sent the tribe $5,000 to create a new totem. The tribe wrote on the cancelled check, “Thanks for finally paying for the first one, but it will cost you $5,000 more for another!”
