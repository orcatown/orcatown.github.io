title: SEATTLE: The Future is 1962
published: true

Seattle doesn’t have a strong train-centric public transportation system like Chicago or Washington DC, but it does have a buses, old fashioned streetcars and a MONORAIL.

The monorail was built in 1962 to get people from the downtown center to Seattle Center during the 62 Seattle World’s Fair. The Space Needle (ug-mo) is from the same time period.

The worst of 60's Mod, right in our backyard!

I spent part of the day at a career fair representing and recruiting for the agency. The career fair was rather eye opening, as I hadn’t been to one since I was 22 in grad school at William and Mary. At the time I was a student vaguely interested in being employed at some point, and I saw the CIA booth and decided that yes, I would like a job that involved reading, writing, and foreign travel.   I can credit that day at the career fair as the one that led me to my job now, so I am a big supporter of them.

This time I was on the other side of the booth, talking to a wide variety of people. Some were students, some had worked for decades and were laid off, a few were looking for second careers unlike their first, and most had IT, MBAs or accounting backgrounds (so much for the jokes about liberal arts majors never finding jobs, says the music/history major). I tried to direct them to any government job that would fit them, as there is something depressing about being a 27 year old of average intelligence and below-par math skills trying to help a 40 something of high intelligence and marketable skills find a job.  It made me very grateful that I have a job.

So after a day of rare thoughtfulness, Chris and I decided the monorail to Nordstrom would be a fun evening trek.

Monorail!

The Monorail is about as narrow as the El in Chicago, but it does not smell like pee. It is about as modular as the Metro in DC, but does not cause all the passengers to puke. Thus, it is pretty awesome and got points from us. The ride to Nordstrom (or Westfield Center, to be exact, but really Nordstrom is all that matters), takes about two minutes and goes a mile, but it’s a good way to avoid the Seattle street crazies.

Passic Mecca - Flagship Nordstrom

Nordstrom was started in Seattle, and Seattleites are very loyal to their home store. I haven’t actually shopped there beyond the cafe, in part because I am waiting for Mom to come out to visit. Speaking of which, I can’t wait for Kai to come out in two weeks, I am so happy to see a family member. Chris and I worry (well, I voice the worry more often) that nobody would come out to see us because it is so far and tickets are relatively expensive.  As someone who is very family oriented, my only qualm about living here is how far it is from everyone.  Especially since I think everyone in both our families would really like it out here. It’s funny that most of the time parents worry their kids will never visit or call, when for me it’s the opposite!

Plus Lee Schetter misses Mali Passic. Lee is needy like his Mom.

On our way back to the monorail, we stopped into “Lush”, that pungent store that seems to permeate the streets of cities worldwide. In fact, I first realized they were worldwide when the smell kept popping up in random Swiss streets on Mom and my trip to CH in 2006.  The Colombian exchange continues!

Chris and I usually avoid the store because it is one of those where the salespeople bombard you when you step in, when you look at a product, when you’re standing there, and when you leave. Seriously, in the tiny hole-in-the-wall store in Seattle, Chris and I were approached and given a spiel at four different displays, but four different salespersons. Gah!

On the way home from verbal assault by soap salesmen, we ran into one of Seattle’s most common street characters, the gigantic Pacific Seagull.

This one found a snack

Mom keeps calling Seattle “grubby” from the photos (as if the city is a giant hoarders house), so i suppose this won’t make her change her mind. But! I have to say that trash on the streets isn’t common. Seagulls though, watch out, they will pickpocket you if given a chance.
